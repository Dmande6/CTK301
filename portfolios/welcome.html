            <h3>I have always been a big nerd on many franchises like Marvel, DC, and Star Wars. Even a few of my alltime favoirite movies are apart of these franchises like 'Spider-Man:Into the Spider-verse' and "The Batman". What I wanted to do was create a cool website based on the world of Star Wars, as if you were in that world buying something online.

                Some of my work I have done in the past was creating video game videos for YouTube. During the 2020 lockdown, I used this time to make videos with me and my friends just to kill time. I would use powerdirector to help me make them and pull images from the internet to put new type of humor into it. The first video I ever created for YouTube was a recreation of a famous Star Wars moment in a video game.
